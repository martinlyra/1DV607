== RUNNING ==
In the bin/ folder, you can find a .dll, it is compiled for use with Net.Core 2.1. So you have to run it from your
terminal using this command:

dotnet ./1DV607A2.ddl

== SOURCE ==
In the src/ folder, you can find the source code for the executables. The language is C# (CSharp)
Tested to be working on Windows 10 64-bit. I recommend opening the source in Visual Studio 2017.

=== COMPIILING THE SOURCE ===

Should running the .dll be out of your question. Try compiling a self-contained binary. Have your terminal set to 
the same directory as the .sln file (should be 'bin/'), then run this command, depending on your system:

dotnet -c release -r win10-x64
dotnet -c release -r osx-x64
dotnet -c release -r linux-x64

If you are running 32-bit, then replace the '64' with '32'; win10 for Windows 10, osx for Mac/iOS/OSX, linux for 
well... Linux.

Should everything be successful, then you should find them as a new folder in bin/1DV607A2/bin/

Only the class diagram was automatically generated by software, the rest were handmade and can contain errors
and overlooked details. Kindly give a constructive feedback on how they can be improved.

Cheers and good luck!

PS: (If you are new to Visual Studio, and interested in using it, then I'd recommend the Community edition)
